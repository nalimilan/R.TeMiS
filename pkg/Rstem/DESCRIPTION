Title: Interface to Snowball implementation of Porter's word stemming
 algorithm.
Description: An R interface to the C code that implements Porter's
  word stemming algorithm for collapsing words to a common root
  to aid comparison of texts.  There is code to for different
  languages (i.e. danish, dutch, english, finnish, french, german,
  norwegian, portuguese, russian, spanish, swedish).
  However, these may not be applicable if the words require 
  UTF encoding.
  This is extensible by allowing different routines to be specified to 
  create the C routines used in the stemming, permitting debugging, 
  profiling, pool management, caching, etc.

Note: This package is setup to support stemming for languages other than English
   and to dynamically fetch code for languages from the Snowball web site. 
   The inst/scripts/download script fetches the code for languages supported by Snowball
   and includes it in the distribution.  Support for Unicode is needed in R.
