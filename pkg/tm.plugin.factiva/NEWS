Version 1.5 - 2014-07-05
    * Fix encoding issues on non-UTF-8 systems, adding back the

Version 1.4 - 2014-05-31

    * Remove the 'encoding' argument to FactivaSource()
      as it is not supported by tm 0.6 (normally not needed).

    * Ensure meta-data variables which are supposed to contain
      only one value always do so.

Version 1.3 - 2014-01-10
    * Extract Company, Industry, Information Provider Code (IPC) and
      Information Provider Description (IPD) meta-data (based on a
      patch by Grigorij Ljubownikow).

Version 1.1 - 2012-06-30
    * Add support for HTML files since Factiva no longer allows exporting to XML.
    * Work around encoding issues on Windows (for HTML only).
    * Preserve paragraphs information so that e.g. makeChunks() from tm can be used
      to split documents into smaller pieces.

    * Initial release with support for XML files.
